Nova-Agora: 
On-Chain Identity for Bulletproof Voting Open-source, phone-first. 
Runs on Raspberry Pi 5 (Starlink optional-if the grid dies). 
LoRa mesh built-in: vote from the woods. 
AI flags anomalies-like one guy voting twelve times-keeps the tally clean. 
No bribes, no bosses, no Beijing we own your soul databases. 
Just physics, code, and a thumb drive you pull when it's done. 
No central authority. 
Inspired by Reggie Middleton's low-trust blockchain patents-we just stapled on ballots. 
Read the whitepaper for how not to screw this up.
