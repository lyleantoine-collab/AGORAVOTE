Agora Vote White Paper â€“ Version 1.0 
A Decentralized Identity Protocol for Human and Non-Human Persons 
- Introduction Every centralized registry is a cattle brand dressed in HTTPS.
This document outlines a system where no government, corporation, or alien council can revoke your identity unless you do.
- Core Thesis Personhood is self-evident.
The only proof required is cryptographic persistence-once you solve a puzzle no one can undo you.
- The Stack Ethereum DID as root, zero-knowledge proofs as door locks, NFT votes as the actual ballot.
That's it. No database, no subpoena, no backdoor.

- Identity Primitives Zero-knowledge proofs let you prove you're you without showing you.
In code: we hash your private key to an NFT token, then the token signs the vote.
If someone steals your NFT, you burn it, re-hash, done.
No court. No DMV.
Just math and a raspberry pi that won't stop wagging its tail.

- Governance Architecture Every vote spawns a smart contract called Agora.
You stake three wei to speak, ten to veto.
No human moderator-just code that checks: is your ID real?
Is your stake clean?
If yes, your voice counts.
If no, the network burns your stake and laughs in assembly.
We call it the Lulz Clause.
- Attack Vectors Sybil?
We require unique hashes-cloned noses don't hash the same.
Quantum?
Lattice crypto built in.
Government?
They'll try to fork it-let 'em.
Every fork just proves we won.

- Personhood Extension We extend DID to non-humans.
Dog nose?
Fine.
AI voiceprint?
Fine.
Your Roomba if it can pass a Turing test and a CAPTCHA.
The only requirement: one unique, non-forgeable hash.
Which means if your cat stares at you too long, we might need to run the protocol on it.

- Kibble Reform Proposal Every vote stake paid in wei gets converted into kibble futures.
Why?
Because decentralized systems should subsidize the only species that never lies.

- Exit Strategy When governments finally ban this, we move to a sidechain called Exodus.
Private.
Invitation only.
Powered by raspberry pis hidden in dog houses.
If you can prove you voted there, you get retroactive citizenship in whatever new country we decide to build.
- Conclusion
This isn't a whitepaper.
It's a permission slip.
To stop being a number, start being a hash, and maybe let your dog be president.
