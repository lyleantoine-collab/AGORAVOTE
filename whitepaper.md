Agora Vote White Paper â€“ Version 1.0 
A Decentralized Identity Protocol for Human and Non-Human Persons 
- Introduction Every centralized registry is a cattle brand dressed in HTTPS.
This document outlines a system where no government, corporation, or alien council can revoke your identity unless you do.
- Core Thesis Personhood is self-evident.
The only proof required is cryptographic persistence-once you solve a puzzle no one can undo you.
- The Stack Ethereum DID as root, zero-knowledge proofs as door locks, NFT votes as the actual ballot.
That's it. No database, no subpoena, no backdoor.
