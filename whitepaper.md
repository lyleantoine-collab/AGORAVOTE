Agora Vote White Paper â€“ Version 1.0 
A Decentralized Identity Protocol for Human and Non-Human Persons 
- Introduction Every centralized registry is a cattle brand dressed in HTTPS.
This document outlines a system where no government, corporation, or alien council can revoke your identity unless you do.
- Core Thesis Personhood is self-evident.
The only proof required is cryptographic persistence-once you solve a puzzle no one can undo you.
- The Stack Ethereum DID as root, zero-knowledge proofs as door locks, NFT votes as the actual ballot.
That's it. No database, no subpoena, no backdoor.

- Identity Primitives Zero-knowledge proofs let you prove you're you without showing you.
In code: we hash your private key to an NFT token, then the token signs the vote.
If someone steals your NFT, you burn it, re-hash, done.
No court. No DMV.
Just math and a raspberry pi that won't stop wagging its tail.

- Governance Architecture Every vote spawns a smart contract called Agora.
You stake three wei to speak, ten to veto.
No human moderator-just code that checks: is your ID real?
Is your stake clean?
If yes, your voice counts.
If no, the network burns your stake and laughs in assembly.
We call it the Lulz Clause.
- Attack Vectors Sybil?
We require unique hashes-cloned noses don't hash the same.
Quantum?
Lattice crypto built in.
Government?
They'll try to fork it-let 'em.
Every fork just proves we won.
